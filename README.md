## Courses

Courses is a coding challenge that I participated in during Summer 2020. The challenge first consisted of building a REST API backend and then building a frontend that would connect to that backend through an endpoint.

Courses takes a user's course workload and creates a plan of study based on prerequistes. The backend sorts a given list of classes which is created by a user through the frontend interface. Through HTTP requests, the backend and frontend communicate with each other to successfully display the courses to the user.
